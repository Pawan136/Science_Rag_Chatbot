# Science_Rag_Chatbot
Science RAG Chatbot is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that answers user questions strictly based on the content of uploaded scientific PDFs.  The system prevents hallucinations by retrieving relevant document chunks from a vector database (Pinecone) and generating answers only from the retrieved context using Google Gemini.
